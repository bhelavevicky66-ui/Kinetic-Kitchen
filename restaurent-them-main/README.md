# Kinetic Kitchen 🍽️

**Kinetic Kitchen** is a simple, responsive restaurant menu demo built with HTML and CSS.

## Features

- Clean hero and menu layout
- Responsive grid (4 columns on desktop)
- Images stored in the `image/` folder

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site.
2. (Optional) Run a local server for correct image loading and nicer dev workflow:

   - Using Python 3:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     # then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
     ```

   - Or use VS Code Live Server extension and open the project folder.

## Project structure

```
restaurent-them-main/
├─ index.html
├─ style.css
└─ image/  (dish photos)
```

## Customize

- Edit `style.css` to change styles, colors, breakpoints, or spacing.
- Replace images in `image/` to update dishes.
- Modify `index.html` to add/remove dishes or sections.
